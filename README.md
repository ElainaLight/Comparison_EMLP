# Scalars are universal: Gauge-equivariant machine learning, structured like classical physics

Scalar products and scalar contractions of the scalar, vector, and tensor inputs are powerful. Deep learning models using these scalars respect the gauge symmetries—or coordinate freedom—of physical law.

This repository provides codes to construct invariant and equivariant neural networks on the same sythetic datasets used in ICML2021 paper [A Practical Method for Constructing Equivariant Multilayer Perceptrons for Arbitrary Matrix Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09459) 

To compare the simulation results with those using *EMLP* proposed in [A Practical Method for Constructing Equivariant Multilayer Perceptrons for Arbitrary Matrix Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09459), this repository imported codes from [equivariant-MLP](https://github.com/mfinzi/equivariant-MLP.git).
